4. All components must be:

   - Accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
   - Use Shadcn/UI primitives where applicable
   - Server Components by default, "use client" only where needed (interactivity)

5. AdSlot component logic:
   - Check if there's an active internal ad for the given placement_location
   - If yes, render the internal ad image with target_url link, track impression
   - If no, render AdSense ad unit (with configurable slot ID from site settings)
   - If neither, render null (no empty space)

6. Social Share Buttons component:
   - Facebook share
   - Twitter/X share
   - Copy link to clipboard
   - Native share (Web Share API on mobile)

7. SEO for homepage:
   - generateMetadata() returning:
     - title: "GalaPo – Discover Olongapo City | Business Directory"
     - description: "Find the best restaurants, shops, services, and more in Olongapo City. Your complete city directory and guide."
     - openGraph with image, title, description
     - twitter card

Output ALL component files with complete code. Make sure Leaflet is properly loaded client-side only (dynamic import with ssr: false).
