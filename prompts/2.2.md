Continuing the GalaPo project. Configure Supabase Storage buckets and Auth settings.

Provide TWO things:

PART 1: SQL to run in Supabase SQL Editor for storage policies:

1. Create storage buckets:
   - "logos" — for business logos (public read, authenticated upload)
   - "listings" — for listing gallery images (public read, authenticated upload)
   - "deals" — for deal images (public read, authenticated upload)
   - "events" — for event images (public read, authenticated upload)
   - "blog" — for blog featured images (public read, super admin upload only)
   - "payments" — for payment proof screenshots (private, authenticated upload, super admin + owner read)
   - "claims" — for business claim proof documents (private, authenticated upload, super admin + owner read)
   - "ads" — for ad banner images (public read, super admin upload only)
   - "pages" — for static page content images (public read, super admin upload only)

2. For each bucket, create RLS storage policies:
   - Public buckets: Anyone can SELECT (read). Authenticated users can INSERT. Owners and super admin can UPDATE/DELETE their own files.
   - Private buckets: Only the uploader and super admin can SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE.
   - File size limits: images max 5MB, documents max 10MB
   - Allowed MIME types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp for images. Plus application/pdf for claims bucket.

PART 2: Step-by-step Supabase Dashboard instructions for:

1. Auth settings:
   - Enable Email/Password sign-up
   - Disable email confirmation for now (streamline onboarding)
   - Set up redirect URLs for local dev and production
   - Configure password minimum length: 8 characters

2. Provide the Next.js 16 code for:
   - /lib/supabase-storage.ts — helper functions:
     - uploadFile(bucket, path, file): returns public URL
     - deleteFile(bucket, path)
     - getPublicUrl(bucket, path)
     - uploadPaymentProof(file, userId, paymentId)
     - uploadClaimProof(file, userId, listingId)
     - uploadListingImage(file, listingId, sortOrder)
     - uploadLogo(file, listingId)
     - uploadAdBanner(file, adId)
     - uploadBlogImage(file, postId)

Output complete SQL and TypeScript code.
