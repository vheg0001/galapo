Continuing the GalaPo city directory project. Set up the testing foundation.

TECH STACK:
- Next.js 16 with TypeScript (already set up)
- Use Vitest (latest 2026 version) as test runner (faster than Jest for Vite-based setups)
- React Testing Library (latest)
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) v2 for API mocking

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Install and configure Vitest with:
   - vitest.config.ts
   - Support for TypeScript path aliases matching tsconfig
   - Support for React component testing
   - Coverage reporter (v8)
   - Setup file for React Testing Library

2. Install and configure React Testing Library:
   - @testing-library/react (latest)
   - @testing-library/jest-dom (latest)
   - @testing-library/user-event (latest)

3. Install and configure MSW v2:
   - Create /tests/mocks/handlers.ts with placeholder handlers
   - Create /tests/mocks/server.ts for test server setup
   - Create mock data factories at /tests/mocks/factories.ts for:
     - createMockListing()
     - createMockCategory()
     - createMockUser()
     - createMockDeal()
     - createMockEvent()
     - createMockSubscription()
     - createMockPayment()
   - Each factory should return realistic sample data matching the TypeScript types

4. Create test directory structure:
   /tests
     /unit          → Unit tests
     /integration   → Integration tests
     /mocks         → MSW handlers and factories
     /setup.ts      → Global test setup

5. Add test scripts to package.json:
   - "test": run all tests
   - "test:unit": run unit tests only
   - "test:integration": run integration tests only
   - "test:coverage": run with coverage report
   - "test:watch": run in watch mode

6. Write the FIRST test to verify setup works:
   - Test that generateSlug utility function works correctly
   - Test that formatCurrency returns proper Philippine Peso format
   - Test that all mock factories return valid typed objects

Output all files with complete code. Ensure all packages are 2026 compatible.
